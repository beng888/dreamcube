    title: "The Blinded II Puzzle Box by Dee Dixon",
    date: "SEPTEMBER 05, 2020 • MIKE VODOVOZ",
    description: [
      "Our family at PuzzleBoxWorld.com is constantly scouring the world for talented puzzle artisans to showcase.  Who would have thought we would find a crafter with incredible abilities right in front of our nose.  Dee Dixon is such a creator and checks all the boxes we are looking for. Dee was a full time trucking supervisor for an excavation company, who recently hung it up to pursue his dream.  Residing from a town nicknamed  “The City of Trees”, Boise, Idaho, inhabited by early 19th-century French Canadian trappers, Dee stays busy by thinking up puzzles with sequences and unique internal mechanisms. As a relatively new crafter, his following has grown enormously and quickly.",
      "Full disclosure, I missed out on some of his early releases and started kicking myself on how this was possible.  Luckily, I am avid follower of Steve Canfields, “Boxes and Booze” blog, https://boxesandbooze.blogspot.com and picked up on the release of some of Dee Dixons latest puzzles.  Steve seems to have a knack for finding and promoting talented crafters and Dee is no exception. Recently, we were fortunate to acquire Dee’s Blinded II Puzzle Box, When released, the puzzle sold out very quickly as it is a sequential discovery puzzle, my personal favorite style.  Constructed in Sapele, Zebrawood and Maple, colors are nicely contrasted with angled spline keys to reinforce the miter joints.",
      "This particular puzzle can be challenging to solve.  The puzzle has a peculiar tiny block affixed to the lid which seems to be out place and can be removed.  Could this be a tool required for the mechanism?  Shake the puzzle and there is a rattle which brings the owner to realize there is going to be more to the puzzle than simple slide or spin style..  Still working on the solution,, I have found that I may take a few steps forward and make some progress, only to find that I am at the beginning again.  Frustrated to say the least, I have reached out to Dee to get clues as the solutions to his puzzles are not included. Dee has given hints when asked, but he does not give up the secrets of his puzzles easily.",
      "The Blinded II puzzle is extremely well crafted and I was pleased with the size being 5 x 3.5 x 3 inches which fit nicely in the hand, allowing easy manipulation of the steps.  Not for the faint of heart, this puzzle is challenging and if you are looking for a easily solved trick puzzle box, this may not be a good choice.",

    title: 'The "Side Swiper" Puzzle Box by Ryan Hughbanks',
    date: "AUGUST 18, 2020 • MIKE VODOVOZ",
    description: [
      "Looking for a challenging Puzzle Box with MULTIPLE hidden spaces, secured tools, magical keys, secret drawers and much more?? Enter Ryan Hughbanks….a new crafter from America’s Heartland. A Nebraskan farmer by day and  woodworker by night, he has released his first creation for purchase aptly named the “Side Swiper” Puzzle.  ",
      "This puzzle can be regarded as more of a trick “chest” as it measures an impressive 10.5 x 7.5 x 6.5 inches and is very heavily constructed.  Crafted in Maple, Walnut, Cherry, Oak, Purpleheart, Alder, Poplar and Padauk this work is an absolute showpiece.",
      "Ryan presents clues along the way that are right in your face, but will you be able to pick up on the hints?  Though not obvious, once you are able to translate Ryan’s thought process, everything seems to make sense. After each code is cracked you will move to all sides of the puzzle to work with drawers, keyholes and latches that are prominently displayed. As you move from task to task, a tool may be presented along the way. This will assist in the solution, but each utensil will only be helpful if it is used correctly and manipulated to get to each progressive stage.  In all, SEVEN hidden spaces will be unveiled.",
      "If you are talented or lucky enough to solve the Side Swiper Puzzle Box, a trademarked wooden tile is found. Finished…not quite.  To reset the puzzle box is also engaging and patience and perseverance is required. Now….are you up to the challenge?",

    title: "The Takarabako Puzzle crafted by Rick Jenkins",
    date: "SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 • MIKE VODOVOZ",
    description: [
      `We present to you the Takarabako Puzzle crafted by Rick Jenkins.  Takarabako in Japanese is defined as “Strong Box” or “Treasure Chest.”  It was Rick's FIRST independent project and was well anticipated.  For those of you that may not be familiar with Rick, he is the infamous apprentice to Robert Yarger of Stickman Puzzles for approximately the past 2-3 years.  News came out from Rob Yarger (Stickman) that a new creation would be released by Rick through emails and I quickly signed on.  The reputations of these two crafters remain to be extremely well recognized and it was an easy purchase for me.`,
      ` After contacting Rick directly, I pretty much begged him to purchase the #1/40 puzzle.  For some reason, I desired the first of the series….I don’t really know why but it just seemed a good idea at the time. Rick gladly obliged to which I was very thankful.`,
      `When the box arrived, I quickly was puzzled by the lattice style design and noticed it was a delicate creation.  While rotating the box in my hands over soft cloth, it appeared to be a box within a box.

      I pressed and prodded initially and had a little difficulty finding movement.  The finish on the puzzle was well done as the construction of the box was intricate.  After some time, I was able to discover some of the tricks of the puzzle and was surprised as some of the movements were unique to other puzzles I have been exposed to.  The box does contain a smaller hidden space, which of course is a must for my particular taste and collection.`,
      ` It was noted that the Takarabako box was a little more work than Rick I think has anticipated.  While some make hope for a second run of these puzzles, I doubt that more will be constructed.  I was extremely happy to add such a unique puzzle to my collection.

      At the time of this writing, Rick is busy working on the release of his third solo project.  From the look of the drawings, this particular puzzle (not named as of yet), appears to be another interesting work.   I will be excited to see what he comes up with next!`,

    title: "The Slammed Car Puzzle Box designed by Junichi (Juno) Yananose",
    date: "SEPTEMBER 01, 2019 • MIKE VODOVOZ",
    description: [
      `This is my very FIRST puzzle box designed by Junichi Yananose, a wonderful crafter residing in Queensland, Australia.  Although a little bit spendy, I am a sucker for sequential discovery puzzles where small tools and gimmicks can be found along the way of finding a hidden space(s).  The other aspect that I found appealing is that this trick box takes on the form of a car as I am not only a puzzler but a car enthusiast.
    Okay...let's get down to it.  This work is requires quite a few steps (15-20 as explained by the crafter) to open and it is best to set it on the floor or soft cloth when manipulating the steps.  The wheels DO move freely so don't let the car drive away without you.`,
      `The appearance of the puzzle to me is striking.  The natural wood colors contrast nicely and the accents on the headlight and side mirrors makes the car look more alive.  As you  can see, the Slammed Car also has some amount of definition and detail, showcasing windows, door handles and grill, though the bottom is flat..`,
      `As you progress through the opening sequences, the hidden objects that are discovered are items you would expect to find in repairing a car, which makes this trick box even more enjoyable.  If you are able to solve the puzzle, the crafter explains there is a "hidden loaf of bread" held inside.`,
      `The Slammed Car Puzzle Box weighs one pound and approximately measures a little bit over 7 inches in length.  I held off on purchasing the Slammed Car initiatively but after it won the Jury Grand Prize at the 2019 Nob Yoshigahara Puzzle Design Competition held in Japan, I figured it would be a must for my collection. `,
